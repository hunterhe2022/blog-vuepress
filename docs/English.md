# [How to write in plain English](https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html)


## Keep your sentences short
Most experts would agree that clear writing should have an average sentence length of 15 to 20 words.
  
  
## Prefer active verbs

This matter will be considered by us shortly. (Passive)
We will consider this matter shortly. (Active)

## Good uses of passives
There are times of course when it might be appropriate to use a passive.

To make something less hostile - 'this bill has not been paid' (passive) is softer than 'you have not paid this bill' (active).

## Use lists where appropriate
If you can prove that:

- you were somewhere else at the time;
- you were not related to Mary; and
- you are over 21;

you should be all right

## Avoid nominalisations
too many nouns make writing very dull and heavy-going.

Here are some examples.

We had a discussion about the matter.
**We discussed the matter.**

There will be a stoppage of trains by drivers.
**Drivers will stop the trains.**

The implementation of the method has been done by a team.
**A team has implemented the method.**

## Apologising

If you are replying to a tricky letter or a complaint, or are dealing with a difficult problem, put yourself in the reader's shoes. Be professional, not emotional. You may have to give a firm, unwelcome answer, but be as helpful and polite as possible. If you are going to apologise, do so early. If the problem is your fault, say so. Apologise completely and concisely, sympathetically and sincerely. And whether it is your fault or not, try to emphasise what you can do for the other person.
